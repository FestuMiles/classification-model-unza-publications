        "The University of Zambia (UNZA) produces numerous research publications annually across diverse faculties. However, these publications are not systematically classified according to Zambia’s Vision 2030 sector categories, making it challenging for policymakers, funding bodies, and administrators to assess how research aligns with national development priorities. Manual classification is time-consuming, inconsistent, and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system to classify research outputs into Vision 2030 sectors using only publication titles."
